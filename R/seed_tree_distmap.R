#' Distance map to nearest seed source
#'
#' @description Creation of a distance map for the study area. The distance to
#'  the nearest seed source is calculated for every raster cell.
#'
#' @param raster Raster data set with tree species classification of specific
#'  tree species and tree species groups.
#' @param species Represents the numerical value by which the tree species of
#'  interest is encoded in the raster data set.
#'
#' @return A SpatRaster object containing the distances to seed source.
#'  The object has the same resolution and extent as the input raster.

#geom Geodata set representing the study area. This can be a polygon or point dataset. It describes the outer boundary of the study area. A buffer of 1000 m is placed around the Bbox to possibly take into account seed trees outside the study area
